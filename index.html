  <h2>too many people do not read enough books, and are ignorant to cultures and lessons from the past.</h2>
  <p>books like 1984, metroplis, farenhiet 451, and many other books tell cautionary times made for the context of their time, showing a deeper way to understand the past, and the present.
some people think reading isnt worth the time it takes, or that its too boring. but the knowledge of humanity, and lingustics inside of every book is enough to change your life for the better</p>
